153	 Dave Moriarty Dave Moriarty PhD Student Department of Computer Sciences The University of Texas at Austin Research Sequential decision tasks appear in many practical real-world problems including control, resource allocation, and routing Such tasks can be characterized by the following scenario: An agent observes a state of a dynamic system and selects from a finite set of actions The system then enters a new state upon which the agent must select another action The system may return a payoff for each decision made or for a sequence of decisions The objective is to select the sequence of actions that return the highest total or cumulative payoff In my research, I evolve Neural Networks with Genetic Algorithms to learn and perform sequential decision tasks I am particularly interested in tasks where problem-specific knowledge is currently unavailable or costly to obtain Some domains that I have studied include game playing, intelligent control, and constraint satisfaction For more information, see my list of publications Education M S in Computer Science, The University of Texas at Austin, 1994 B S in Computer Science, Tulane University , 1992 Contact Information Office: Taylor Hall 5 142 Phone: (512) 471-9585 Email address: moriarty@cs utexas edu Postal address: The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Sciences, TAY 2 124 Austin, TX 78712-1188 Local Links UTCS Neural Networks home page AI lab home page UTCS home page UT Austin home page Other Useful Links Research Links Sports Links Misc Links visitor number 	0

167	 UT Knowledge-Based Systems Group Knowledge-Based Systems Group Bruce Porter Rich Mallory Peter Clark Art Souther Fred Prado Charles Callaway and (not shown above): Carl Andersen, Steve Correl Overview Our group is part of the Department of Computer Sciences at Univ Texas at Austin The long-term goal of our research is to develop technology for constructing and using large, multifunctional knowledge bases on computers These knowledge bases would significantly improve current expert systems and tutoring systems because they contain the broad knowledge of a domain required to perform multiple tasks and to explain domain knowledge from multiple viewpoints During the past eight years, we have built a large knowledge base in one area of biology, and developed methods for automatically answering a variety of questions using the knowledge base Containing about 180,000 facts concerning 30,000 concepts, our knowledge base is one of the largest of its kind (i e its content is structured and formally represented) In addition to expanding this knowledge base, we are also beginning to construct similar knowledge bases in other domains, most notably, the domain of Distributed Computing We are especially encouraged by the results from using our knowledge base for a variety of AI tasks Most recently, James Lester used the biology knowledge base to test his system for explanation generation The system generated about 60 explanations, expressed in English, concerning biological objects and events In a controlled experiment, domain experts found little difference between these explanations and those written by their colleagues Currently, we are extending the types of questions that can be answered using automated reasoning with a large knowledge base Jeff Rickel developed a method for "compositional modeling", the task of constructing a model appropriate for answering a prediction ("what-if") question Performing this task well requires building the simplest model that can adequately answer the question - a daunting requirement since knowledge bases like ours implicitly contain MANY models at numerous levels of detail The Qualitative Process Compiler and QSIM are used to simulate the models built by Jeff's program Finally, we are testing the generality of our research results by building a knowledge base in another domain - distributed computing environments (focussing on OSF's DCE) - to construct a help-desk assistant for automatically answering a proportion of customer's questions which would otherwise be phoned in to a normal help-desk Research Projects Our completed and ongoing research projects include: KM/KQL - our knowledge representation language, KnEd - the knowledge base editor, BKB - the biology knowledge base, KASTL - the viewpoint retriever, KNIGHT - explanation and text planning, FARE - natural language generation of text plans, LexEd - computer-aided maintenance for KB lexicons, TRIPEL - compositional modeling for answering prediction questions, Help-Desk Assistant - the DCE Help-Desk Assistant project Researchers Bruce Porter (porter@cs utexas edu) Rich Mallory (mallory@cs utexas edu) Art Souther (souther@cs utexas edu) Charles Callaway (theorist@cs utexas edu) Fred Prado (prado@cs utexas edu) Carl Andersen (searcher@cs utexas edu) Steve Correl (correl@cs utexas edu) Recent alumni and alumnae: Liane Acker (acker@austin ibm com) Erik Eilerts (eilerts@cs utexas edu) Ray Bareiss (bareiss@ils nwu edu) Brad Blumenthal Karl Branting (karl@eolus uwyo edu) Peter Clark (clarkp@redwood rt cs boeing com) James Lester (lester@adm csc ncsu edu) Ken Murray (murray@cyc com) Jeff Rickel (rickel@isi edu) Publications Click here to see some selected publications from our group Other Related KB Projects Click here for an extensive collection of pointers to other KB projects around the world porter@cs utexas edu 	2

Programming is a fun and exciting intellectual challenge CS304P is designed to give you a firm foundation in Pascal programming, and so you will need to put some effort into it Read this page and the Course Syllabus carefully This page is only a summary of the Course Syllabus, which contains all the details of the assignments and other requirements as well as important policies, and the schedules of due dates, exams and other deadlines YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING IN THE SYLLABUS ! Get one without delay Available at Jenn's Copies, 2200 Guadalupe Hundreds of students take this course each semester, so it is highly structured You are responsible for all the details Monitor this page and the newsgroup (utexas class cs304p) frequently for updates This course may take more work than you are expecting, depending on how well prepared you are In any event, this course can become extremely difficult if you get behind Due to the grading procedures, it is very risky to wait until near a deadline to take a quiz or turn in a program A late quiz or program gets only HALF credit! Waiting lines can become very long, hours before a deadline You have been warned Unfortunately, this Web Page is under construction this semester Many of the links go nowhere Our apologies Everyone attends the lecture by Suzy Gallagher every Thursday evening from 5:00 pm to 6:30 pm in Welch 2 224 On Mondays and Wednesdays you will break out into small group sections for discussion of the material with a Teaching Assistant You will have nine programming assignments that are written, debugged and graded in the Programming Laboratory Note that laboratory hours are limited, and that grading hours are even less, and you are responsible for scheduling your work to fit within those limits You will take eight quizzes in the Testing Room Note that Testing Room hours are limited and you are responsible for taking your quizzes before the deadlines WARNING! There are often long waits for available proctors to grade assignments and quizzes for several hours before a deadline You are responsible for submitting your programs and quizzes early enough to be graded There are three exams which must be taken at the prescribed times There are NO make-up exams! As soon as possible at the beginning of the semester, you need to go to the Test Room to get a file opened for you, and a unique identifier assigned as your Student Access Key , or SAK The required textbook is Pascal by Dale & Weems We will cover Chapters 1 through 14 Individual students' backgrounds vary considerably, so this course is partially self-paced If you feel you are well prepared, you may click here for details However, you are still liable for ALL requirements in the syllabus You can use the newsgroup (utexas class cs304p) to communicate with the other students in the class For example, you could form study groups Many students also use it to gripe about this course Thoughtful articles of general interest may elicit a reply from the staff (Updated 3/18/96 phm) 	3

BECAUSE THINGS MAY CHANGE, you should hit the RELOAD BUTTON in your browser when you come to this page, to make sure you're seeing the most recent version Online Course Readings and Reference Material Syllabus Lecture Notes on Declarative Programming Course Notes on Scheme and its Implementation in html for web browsing These notes are under construction Only the first few sections are reasonably well indexed for browsing, and the later sections will change as the course goes along Reading far ahead of the class is likely to be an adventure I suggest that you use this web page with a browser while using a Scheme system interactively (Especially while working through chapter 3, the tutorial ) This will allow you to cut text out of the document and paste it into a running Scheme system THERE ARE ERRORS IN THIS TEXT, especially the later chapters That's another reason to read the html version with a browser, rather than printing out a hardcopy I'll correct most of the errors before we get to those chapters The R4RS (Scheme language definition) in html format for online browsing This lists all of the standard features of Scheme and (tersely) describes what they do For most stuff in this course, my Scheme course notes will be more helpful, but if you want to know about miscellanous functions and exactly what they do, this is the authority First set of Practice Questions There's also a version with answers Second set of Practice Questions There's also a version with answers Quiz 1 (with answers) Third set of Practice Questions There's also a version with answers Notes on naming conventions and indenting for Scheme , which you should consult when doing homework so that I can read your code and grade it sensibly, and notes on drawing data structures Homework assignment on writing merge sort in Scheme , and my solutions to the first three problems (Commented Scheme code ) Notes on a simple reader , including regular expressions, BNF grammar, and the actual code in Scheme Scheme code for a simple backward-chaining propositional calculus theorem prover , which is essentially a little subset of Prolog, and a set of rules for classifying animals , i e , a logic program about kinds of animals, to play with using the theorem prover A picture of some class objects and instances to illustrate the simple object system from the Scheme notes, and another picture showing class objects and the metaclass object , illustrating the circularity that makes the latter self-describing Scheme code for a simple object-based programming system based on classes and generic procedures (inheritance not implemented yet) Notes on type systems , including inheritance and subtyping Take-Home Quiz and the answers (and some explanations) Test 2 and a version of Test 2 with Answers (and some explanations) The main language we'll be using in this course is Scheme , and by default the implementation to use is RScheme , which is installed on the public cs SPARCs (running Solaris) and RS6000's (running AIX) On the CS machine, you run RScheme with the command /p/bin/runscheme If you use your own machine, and you're running Linux or Solaris or any of several other implementations of UNIX, you can get RScheme and install it on your machine---it's free You can find it from Donovan Kolbly's Home Page Be sure to get version 0 7 or later, and ask the TA (Zhu Qing) for a patch to make it friendlier for newbies If you're using your own machine, and it's a Mac, I recommend getting Gambit, Marc Feeley's implementation of Scheme It's free too You can get it from the Scheme Repository (see below) If you're using a PC running Windows or DOS, I'm not sure what the best Scheme to get is There are a bunch available at the Scheme Repository do not use MIT Scheme or Guile---they're not standard Scheme You might try Gambit-C by Mark Feeley, or MzScheme, from Rice If you use something besides RScheme, I recommend getting the Meroon (version 3) object system from the Scheme Repository when we start doing object-oriented programming For a few assignments, you may have to use RScheme under UNIX to take advantage of RScheme's object system, but for most things you should be able to use Meroon The Scheme Repository The Scheme Repository at the University of Indiana has lots of free implementations of Scheme, and various documents on Scheme If you

Lighweight fault-tolerance Lorenzo Alvisi Distributed systems have moved beyond the confines of academia and research labs and are revolutionizing the way in which businesses, governmental organizations, and simple citizens are processing and collecting information Current technological trends promise to dramatically increase the pace of this revolution by enabling the design of highly cooperative distributed applications that go beyond the client-server paradigm to harness the computational power of distributed systems In this new environment, the scope and emphasis of fault-tolerant techniques are about to undergo dramatic changes Fault-tolerance will cease to be an expensive feature required by a handful of applications to tolerate exotic failures To the users of a highly distributed information infrastructure, fault-tolerance will translate to a competitive advantage, guaranteeing reliable access to critical information In this talk we will explore a new way to design and engineer fault-tolerant solutions, which we call lightweight fault-tolerance The goals of lightweight fault-tolerance are: To require few dedicated resources and have a negligible impact on performance during failure-free executions To scale its cost depending on the severity and number of failures that need to be tolerated To integrate with applications in a way transparent to the application programmer To enable and support emerging applications that will communicate through messages as well as files To address software-generated faults effectively Cilk and Cilk-NOW: Adaptive and Reliable Parallel Computing on Networks of Workstations Robert Blumofe This presentation overviews Cilk (pronounced &quot;silk&quot;), an algorithmic parallel multithreaded language, and Cilk-NOW , a runtime system that supports a functional subset of Cilk on networks of workstations Cilk-NOW provides &quot;adaptive parallelism&quot; and fault tolerance tranparently to user programs Adaptive parallelism means that the set of workstations on which a Cilk program runs can grow and shrink dynamically depending on the availability of idle workstations and on the amount of parallelism within the program In addition, a Cilk program can continue execution even if one or more of its workstations crashes, because the Cilk-NOW runtime system automatically detects and recovers from such failures The presentation includes a live demonstration Distributed I/O: from Clusters to Internets Mike Dahlin This presentation gives an overview of current issues in distributed file system I/O Technology trends and new applications motivate more aggressive cluster and wide area network I/O systems In clusters, fast networks allow machines to cooperate closely to service I/O requests The xFS file system uses close cooperation among nodes to provide better performance and availability than a single central server In wide area networks, the challenge is to provide good performance, availability, and consistency despite limited network performance and node or network failures The wFS file system project will explore these issues The Spatial Semantic Hierarchy for Human and Robot Cognitive Maps Benjamin Kuipers Human cognitive maps rely on several different representations for large-scale space, each with its own ontology Similarly, a variety of different approaches have been proposed for robot exploration and mapping of unknown environments We cast these diverse representations into a natural structure that we call the Spatial Semantic Hierarchy (SSH), in which the objects, relations, and assumptions at each level are abstracted from the levels below Each level of the SSH has its own mathematical foundation The control level allows the robot and its environment to be formalized as a continuous dynamical system, whose stable equilibrium points can be abstracted to a discrete set of &quot;distinctive states &quot; Trajectories linking these states can be abstracted to actions, giving a discrete causal graph representation of the state space The causal graph of states and actions can in turn be abstracted to a topological network of places and paths Local metrical models, such as occupancy grids, of neighborhoods of places and paths can then be built on the framework of the topological network without their usual problems of global consistency Mathematical Principles of Logic Programming Vladimir Lifschitz Logic programming, as well as its sister approach, functional programming, is based on the view that a computer program does not need to contain any explicit operational instructions Instead, it can simply provide a set of facts about the problem that is sufficient to solve it Such a &quot;declarative&quot; program can be executed using methods of automated reasoning Prolog is the best known logic programming language The mathematical theory of logic programming is concerned with defining the semantics of logic programming languages, describing the reasoning algorithms used to implement them, and investigating the soundness of these algorithms Adaptive Libraries and High Level Optimization Calvin Lin This talk describes a new approach to building software libraries By making libraries that can adapt---in both their implementation and their interfaces---to different application needs and different hardware platforms, we can produce libraries that are more efficient and more widely usable We describe a new framework for building such libraries, we describe three planned experiments that apply these techniques to libraries for parallel scientific computation, and we explain how our approach facilitates high level optimizations Learning Sequential Decision Tasks Through Symbiotic Evolution of Neural Networks Risto Miikkulainen A novel reinforcement learning method called SANE (Symbiotic, Adaptive Neuro-Evolution) evolves a population of neurons through genetic algorithms to form a neural network for a given task Symbiotic evolution promotes both cooperation and specialization in the population, which results in a fast, efficient genetic search and discourages convergence to suboptimal solutions SANE is able to extract domain-specific information even under sparse reinforcement, which makes it an effective approach to a broad range of sequential decision tasks such as robot control, game playing, and resource management Alamo: The Net as a Data Warehouse Dan Miranker The Alamo effort is directed at intra-net development, and inter-net users who can enumerate interesting sites and data sources The goal is to integrate the data sources and provide the user with the illusion of a single virtual database, followed by query, analysis and presentation tools Central to the Alamo architecture is a software bus called the Abstract Search Machine (ASM) The ASM is a CORBA compliant interface that provides a uniform interface to heterogeneous data sources Beyond simple data access, the ASM embodies a higher level of abstraction enabling the efficient coding of clever search algorithms and separating and isolating system concerns, including buffering and data prefetch The broad claim is that high performance, often optimal, implementations of advanced database facilities such as an object-oriented query engine, a deductive inference engine, an active database engine and data mining facilities can all be constructed using the ASM as a common interface Finally, since the output of each of these advanced database facilities can themselves serve as data sources, the components of the Alamo architecture can be composed to resolve higher level data integration problems In particular we anticipate using the elements of Alamo itself to represent meta-data and resolve both structural and semantic conflicts among the data sources Ultimately, further compositions will embody complex knowledge-bases and be able to answer high-level queries Learning to Process Natural Language Using Inductive Logic Programming Raymond J Mooney Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) addresses the problem of learning Prolog programs from examples The representational power of first-order logic offers advantages over standard machine learning methods constrained to use fixed-length feature vectors We are applying ILP methods to natural-language learning where we believe this richer representation offers important advantages We have developed an ILP system, CHILL, for learning deterministic parsers from a corpus of parsed sentences CHILL obtains superior results on several artificial corpora previously used to test neural-network methods, and encouraging results on the more realistic ATIS corpus of airline queries CHILL has also been used to the automatically develop a complete natural-language interface that translates English database queries into executable Prolog form, producing a more accurate parser than a hand-built system for querying a small geographic database We have also developed an ILP system, FOIDL, which has been applied to learning the past tense of English, surpassing the previous results of neural-network and decision-tree methods on this problem Software Reuse by Specialization of Generic Procedures through Views Gordon S Novak Jr Software reuse is clearly a good idea, but it is difficult to achieve in practice: if your data does not fit the assumptions of the software, reusing the software will be difficult In our approach, views describe how application data types implement the abstract types used in generic procedures A compilation process can specialize a generic procedure to produce a version that is customized for the application data Graphical user interfaces make it easy to specify views An Automatic Programming Server has been implemented on the World Wide Web; it will write specialized programs for the user, in a desired language, and serve the source code to the user as a file Analysis of Algorithms Greg Plaxton A major focus of theoretical computer science is the design and analysis of asymptotically efficient algorithms (sequential/parallel/distributed, deterministic/randomized) for specific computational problems In this research area, it is not uncommon to come across well-written papers in which, informally: (i) the main underlying ideas are conceptually straightforward, (ii) the formal presentation is surprisingly lengthy, and (iii) most of the formalism deals with minor side-issues and special cases that have little or nothing to do with the main underlying ideas In such papers, there seems to be a significant gap between the conceptual and formal difficulty of the algorithm being presented Are such gaps inherent, or is conventional mathematical notation simply inadequate for succinctly formalizing certain conceptually straightforward algorithmic ideas In this talk, I will describe a notation for asymptotic analysis, called $O_i$-notation, that significantly reduces the &quot;conceptual-to-formal gap&quot; associated with a non-trivial class of algorithms As a concrete example, I consider the analysis of the well-known linear-time selection algorithm due to Blum, Floyd, Pratt, Rivest, and Tarjan The Design and Evaluation of Parallel Algorithms Vijaya Ramachandran The design and analysis of efficient parallel algorithms for combinatorial problems has been an area of extensive study in recent years, and a large number of algorithms have been developed on the abstract PRAM model of parallel computation In this talk we will describe some of our work in the design of efficient parallel algorithms, and our experience with implementing and evaluating these algorithms on a massively parallel machine (Maspar MP-1) We will then describe a &quot;queuing&quot; variant of the PRAM model, which we propose as a more appropriate model for currently available parallel shared-memory machines than traditional PRAM models Extensible Languages, Open Compilers, and Reflection Paul Wilson Extensible languages allow interesting new features to be added to a language portably, from within the language itself Open compilers allow fairly easy modification of compilers to add new features, analyses, and optimizations Reflection allows a program to examine a representation of interesting parts of itself, and affect its own structure accordingly I'll discuss these things, why they're useful for building modular, portable, and adapatable software I'll also discuss our recent work on the RScheme compiler, an open compiler for an extensible language Last modified: November 15, 1996 Robert Blumofe rdb@cs utexas edu 	3

abstractions that have proved useful or are expected to be useful for designing and building tomorrow's distributed systems These include: global states (cuts, logical and vector clocks, causal message delivery, global property detection) message logging and checkpointing replication management (state machine approach, primary backup approach) agreement protocols (Byzantine agreement, ordered multicast) group programming (techniques and applications) distributed file systems (caching, disconnected operations) time services (Byzantine clock synchronization, NTP) security (encryption, authentication, security in group programming) We will integrate the discussion of the general principles with the presentation of case studies that exemplify how such principles have been used to design and implement real systems Other topics, depending on time and interest, will be presented by me or by some of you (the size of the class does not allow all of you to give a presentation) Such topics may include: distributed shared memory distributed objects kernel support for distributed systems weak consistency for replica management protocols for electronic commerce protocols for wide-area networks Grading There will be 4 or 5 written homework assignment Solutions will be graded F, B, or A Any solution that demonstrates a credible effort on behalf of its authors (whether the solution is right or wrong) will receive a B or better Collaboration on homework assignment by up to three students is permitted and encouraged, but not required When there is such a collaboration, a single solution should be submitted for grading, with the names of the collaborators Other collaborations will be considered violations of Academic Integrity There will be a written, take-home midterm examination, for which no collaboration will be allowed There will be no final exam Each student however will be required to write a final paper (about 20 pages) that surveys one of the issues that we have discussed in class A list of suggested topics will be distributed in class on Monday 4/8 The paper is due at the start of the last class, Wednesday 5/1: hence, you will have 4 weeks to complete the paper You can also team up with a colleague and prepare one or two lectures on a topic not previously covered in class If you choose this option, you and your colleague will only be required to write a single survey paper of about 20 pages I warmly encourage you to consider volunteering for a presentation: it will give you an excellent opportunity to improve your communication skills Problem Sets In this and all subsequent problem sets, you should conform to the following general guidelines: ``Prove'' and ``show'' are synonymous A precise proof is required when you are asked to ``prove'' or ``show'' something To show that something is impossible, you have to give a proof that makes it clear that the problem cannot be solved, no matter what the algorithm is It is insufficient to show that a particular algorithm does not work Any algorithm that you develop must be accompanied by a proof of correctness, unless you explicitly told otherwise Due: Mon, 5 Feb 1996 Problem 1 The snapshot protocols discussed in class and in the textbook assume that communication channels are FIFO Derive a snapshot protocol for an asynchronous system that does not depend on the FIFO assumption, and prove it correct (i e prove that the protocol produces a consistent global state) You may assume that at most one snapshot is being computed at any point during a run Note : The book contains a reference to a paper by Mattern that contains a solution to the problem I urge you to resist the temptation to solve the problem by visiting the library Problem 2 Taking the snapshot of a distributed computation is a general technique for computing stable global predicates More efficient protocols can be derived for computing specific predicates, that are often conceptually simpler and more efficient (in terms of the number of messages they exchange) than a snapshot-based solution In this problem you are required to derive such a ``specialized'' protocol for detecting a deadlock in an asynchronous distributed system Ideally, your protocol would not need a centralized monitor process, and would have a message cost of O(n) , where n is the number of processes in the distributed system (a monitor-based snapshot protocol for detecting deadlock has a cost of O(n*n) ) The suggested solutions to these problems are now online This link points to the postscript file
