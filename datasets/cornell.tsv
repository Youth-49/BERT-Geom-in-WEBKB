Let`s see Where do I start OK! Here goes Once upon a time, long, long ago (actually on November 1, 1973), in a land they call Bharat ( India for the outside world) at precise 12:00pm was born a cute, chubby little baby weighing approximately four pounds He took on the name Deepak (meaning light) and went on (actually he's still in the process) to change the world Incidentally, (or probably out of divine interference) Aishwarya Rai (Miss World 1994) was born on the same day My! Isn't she lucky to be born on the same day as me Leaving out the miniscule details of my earlier life, let's dive straight into high school Well, I'm lucky to have been to National Public School, Bangalore for a greater part of my schooling Now, that's the place for someone to be!! And college Nothings better than KREC Thats where I majored in Computer Science I wonder how long it will be before I get another four year holiday To have been a part of the all-conquering Class of '96 was a joy never to be matched And here I am, at Cornell University pursuing a masters degree in Computer Science Well, I just hope it gets me somewhere And finally, heres a link to my friends : Ashish Aastha Indira Ankit Vineet Back to the main page 	0

This page has been up for a while now, so I've felt inclined to change the first sentence My birth name is Jonathan Barber , but people usually just call me Jon (not J-O- H -N!!) People also call me Ponch or Pooch People used to call me Lake, Fork, Guppie, Skin Mama, Phin, and the list goes on and on I am finishing up my degree as a graduate student in the Masters of Engineering Program in Computer Science at Cornell University I was also an undergrad at Cornell, where I got a BA in Computer Science as well I grew up in a couple of towns in New Jersey, and attended Montgomery High School I'm currently living in Collegetown which is adjacent to the Cornell Campus I'm in a cheap summer sublet on College Ave, which is ultra-convenient, since I can work and play in the same half-mile radius While a student at Cornell, I went Greek, and spent a lot of time at Tau Epsilon Phi , a fraternity on the borders of Cayuga Heights Its kind of hard to believe that those days are over, but on the other hand, its about time What I'm doing Now I have finished my Masters of Engineering Project with Prof Thorsten von Eicken , where we developed the U-Net Packet Filter The filter works with U-Net , which is a high-bandwidth network protocol that can bring parallel computing home to personal computers I also taught the 6-week summer session of CS099: Fundamental Programming Concepts , an introductory course to computers and programming This past year, I was a teaching assistant for CS314: An Introduction to Digital Systems and Computer Organization during Fall-95 and Spring-96 Course and Research Interests This past semester, I worked a lot on RivL ( A Resolution Independent Video Language ), which is one of the products from the Multimedia Research group at Cornell The final product of my labor is two project reports Two Parallel Implementations of Continuous Media RivL An Improved-Implementation of an Object Tracker in RivL I have also taken an interest in high performance compilers My good friend Sugata Mukhopadhyay and I are still finishing up a class project, in which we implemented a SMPD code generator for High-Performance Fortran based on a linear algebra framework (paper coming soon) In the previous semester,my other good friend, Greg Weber and I, developed WeBar Encryption , a smart encryption protocol for frame-dependent video streams (e g MPEG) Unfortunately, I don't have the paper in electronic form, so you'll have to trust me on this The Future Looks Bright, and Wet! At the end of this summer, I'm packing up my gear, and taking a permanent road-trip to Oregon (hopefully with some buddies) If any of you web-surfers are from Oregon, and have some information you'd like to share (good or bad), please write me Once there, I'll be working for Intel Corp , so go ahead and buy a PC A live picture taken from my future home in Portland!

the current version used at Cornell is called Nuprl 4 It differs from its predecessors in having a new term editor designed by Stuart Allen and implemented by Richard Eaton Its internal structure is more modular, making the system suitable for he definition of a wide variety of logics beyond the built-in constructive type theory Also, the entire theorem-proving mechanism has been rebuilt and stream-lined by Paul Jackson, building on the work of Douglas Howe This contributes to the generic nature of Nuprl 4 Finally, this version of the system can refer to itself There is an internal description of the language and its logic built principally by William Aitken using the theory developed by Allen, Howe, and myself Richard Eaton designed a link between the internal description of the logic and the logic itself, which makes it possible to prove theorems about the process of proving theorems We are also engaged in three exciting joint ventures One is with Miriam Leeser of Electrical ENgineering and the other two are in Computer Science; with David Gries on Polya and with Richard Zippel on Weyl With Lesser, we are involved in hardware synthesis and verification Leeser and her student Mark Aagard have used Nuprl to prove the correctness of a 1000-line boolean circuit minimization package, Pbs, used by circuit designers This is a component of Leeser's Bedroc system (it implements the weak division algorithm, which is widely used in circuit design systems) This major theorem proving effort taught us a great deal about the effectiveness of our technology in the hands of expert users from an application domain The second joint venture involves building a model of the Polya programming language and a program refinement mechanism for it, both designed by David Gries, which will enable him to write his handbook of algorithms in the manner that he devised through years of study of the programming process Stuart Allen has givne a formal type-theoretic definition of Polya We expect to be experimenting soon with transforms and trying to capture the programming style that Gries wants We have recently begun a collaboration that we hope to relate to the Polya effort Conal Mannion has been exploring the possibility of using Nuprl in computational science We have been discussing problems with Richard Zippel and are hoping to connect Zippel's symbolic algebra system, Weyl, with Nuprl in the near future This will be used to explore the development of scientific computing software using Weyl and Nuprl together with other tools that Zippel is building Professional Activities Editor, Journal of Symbolic Computation Editor, Academic Press Editor, Journal of Logic and Computation Editor, Oxford University Press General Chair, LICS Program Committee, North American Jumelage Program Committee, Theoretical Aspects of Computer Software Referee/Reviewer: NSERC (Canada), NSF, Theoretical Computer Science University Activities Chair, Computer Science Recruiting Committee Computer Science Computing Facilities Committee Provost's Study Committee on Mathematics Lectures Formal theories and software systems: fundamental connections between computer science and logic INRIA's 25th Anniversary Celebration, Paris, France, December 1992 The Nuprl software development system Computer Science Colloquium, Ben Gurion University, Ber Sheva, Israel, January 1993 Formal theories and software systems State of Israel Symposium, Tel Aviv, Israel, January 1993 ___ Association for Symbolic Logic, Annual Meeting, Notre Dame University, Notre Dame, Indiana, March 1993 Metaprogramming in type theory State University of New York, Buffalo, New York, March 1993 Formal explanations of software Formal Methods and Software Engineering Workshop, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, May 1993 Publications Formal theories and software systems: fundamental connections between computer science and logic In Future Tendencies in Computer Science, Control and Applied Mathematics (ed A Bensoussan and J -P Verjus) Lecture Notes in Computer Science 653 , Springer-Verlag (December 1992), 105-127 Metalevel programming in constructive type theory In Programming and Mathematical Method (ed Manfred Broy), NATO ASI Series F88, Springer-Verlag (1992), 45-93 	1

11	 Keshav Pingali Keshav Pingali Associate Professor PhD MIT, 1986 My research group works in the areas of programming languages and compilers for parallel architectures Our goal is to develop tools for generating parallel code for applications programs that deal with large sparse matrices Most scientific applications involve the numerical solution of partial differential equations The techniques used almost always produce a system of algebraic equations that involve large sparse matrices Unfortunately, existing compiler technology does a poor job of parallelizing sparse matrix programs We take a radically different approach to this problem Our compiler produces parallel sparse-matrix programs from sequential dense-matrix programs, using information from the user about the sparsity structure of matrices in the program This enables us to use tools from the restructuring compiler area Preliminary experiments with some Krylov space solvers show that the code produced by our compiler is competitive with hand-parallelized code in libraries like Argonne's PetSc library We will extend our approach to direct methods for solving linear systems and to applications that require adaptive mesh refinement This project builds on our earlier work on restructuring compilation techniques for dense matrix programs We have developed restructuring techniques for compiling programs to distributed memory and non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architectures like the IBM SP-2 and CM-5, where a processor can access local memory faster than non-local memory To get good performance, the compiler must not only parallelize but must also ensure locality of reference by matching code and data distribution; when non-local references must be made, block transfers are preferable to many small messages We recently developed the best algorithm known for the automatic alignment of computation and data and are incorporating it into our compiler test-bed In earlier work, we developed a novel loop restructuring technique called access normalization, which transforms loop nests for increased locality and potential for block transfers, and implemented it in the LAMBDA loop transformation toolkit - our paper summarizing these results won the best paper prize at ASPLOS V We worked with Hewlett-Packard to transfer this technology to HP's FORTRAN compiler product line for uniprocessors and multiprocessors We have developed new frameworks for program analysis and optimization based on the dependence flow graph (DFG) The DFG knits together the data and control dependence information of a program, permitting the development of optimization algorithms that generate better code than is possible with competing approaches Our results are of independent interest; for example, we recently developed optimal algorithms for control dependence problems, answering a foundational question that had been open for almost a decade This work led to the development of a linear-time algorithm for computing the static single assignment (SSA) form of programs These results have been incorporated into a number of compilers, including those at IBM, Microsoft, HP, and Flavors Professional Activities Panel member and organizer, ACM Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming, 1995 Member, NSF National Young Investigator (NYI) Awards Panel Consultant: Hewlett Packard Labs, Intel Corporation, Army Ballistic Research Labs, Odyssey Research, Math Sciences Institute Referee/Reviewer: ACM TOPLAS, IEEE Transactions on Computers, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, Journal of Supercomputing, IEEE Computer Editorial Board, International Journal of Parallel Programming Awards National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator (1989-1994) IBM Faculty Development Award (1986-88) Best paper prize, ASPLOS V, 1992 Lectures Fast algorithms for control dependence problems Hewlett-Packard Corporation, Chelmsford, Massachusetts, January 1995 ___ Computer Science Department, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, February 1995 ___ Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, May 1995 ___ Microsoft Research Laboratories, Redmond, Washington, June 1995 Publications Solving alignment using elementary linear algebra Proceedings of the Seventh Annual Workshop on Languages and Compilers for Parallel Computers (LCPC), Lecture Notes in Computer Science 892, Ithaca, NY (August 1994) 46-60 (with David Bau, Induprakas Kodukula, Vladimir Kotlyar, and Paul Stodghill) APT: a data structure for optimal control dependence computation ACM SIGPLAN '95 Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI June 1995), 171-185 (with Gianfranco Bilardi) Return to: 1994-1995 Annual Report Home Page Departmental Home Page If you have questions or comments please contact: www@cs cornell edu Last modified: 24 November 1995 by Denise Moore (denise@cs cornell edu) 	1

video a first class data type in our computing environment To this end, my research group, Project Zeno , is building technologies supporting the storage, communication, and processing of continuous media data In contrast to other commercial and research approaches, which require specialized hardware, operating systems, or networks to be usable, all of these technologies we are designing fit into the current research environment Our premise is that the current hardware, software, and communication infrastructure is sufficient to support research into continuous media systems and applications We are verifying this hypothesis by building working systems Our research on storage systems is directed towards building the Zeno distributed video file server The Zeno architecture uses a network of workstations connected by a generic local area network (e g , an ethernet), a common environment in computing research laboratories Each workstation can act simultaneously as both a client and a server of continuous media data As a client, a workstation plays video stored on one or more servers As a server, a workstation is a file server for video data Each client can receive video stored at several servers, and each server can service several clients Compared with large centralized servers, the advantages of this design are: Scalability As new clients are added, new servers are automatically added Load balancing The load generated by serving videos is distributed both across machines and across networks (in the case where the servers are located on different networks) Low initial investment By utilizing existing infrastructure, the Zeno architecture promotes early adoption in research environments with almost no initial investment Our research on communication systems is centered around best effort delivery protocols Such protocols are built on existing network protocols and, in contrast to many other research efforts, do not need to reserve network resources to establish a connection Resource reservation protocols are well suited to the national communication infrastructure where users can be charged on a per call basis for bandwidth and connections, but are poorly suited to network environments where the network is a shared resource equally accessible by all researchers Our approach is appropriate for the latter environments, commonly found in research laboratories The communication protocol we have developed, called Cyclic-UDP, is built on top of the UDP datagram protocol, and is designed to transport audio and video data in playback applications in local, metropolitan, and wide area networks Cyclic-UDP is used by the Zeno file server to deliver audio and video data to clients A paper describing cyclic UDP is available online , as well as the slides from a research talk Our research on processing video data has been two-fold First, we are developing algorithms to process video data in the compressed representation Processing video without decompression leads to dramatic speed-ups in processing performance since it both removes the time-consuming processes of compression and decompression and reduces the amount of data that must be processed Experiments with an implementation of these ideas on JPEG compressed image data indicates that the data can be processed one to two orders of magnitude faster than what was possible with previous approaches We are currently extending these ideas by parallelizing the algorithms using networks of workstations and by developing a method for transcoding video in software In video transcoding, video is translated from one compression format to another, a useful operation for video file servers that must service heterogeneous clients A paper describing compressed domain processing is available online Our research on video processing is also exploring methods to simplify experimentation with video processing by developing a programming language where video is a first class data type This language, called Rivl (pronounced "rival"), allows video processing effects to be specified independent of the resolution and format of the source material The language does for video what Postscript did for text and graphics: it provides a resolution independent method for specifying video processing Thus, the same program can process low quality QuickTime video very quickly while editing decisions are made, and then be used to format a high quality finished product off-line, in much the same way that Postscript can be previewed on a workstation at low quality, then sent to a 2600 dpi printer for camera ready copy A paper describing RVL is available online A talk that reviews our research on video processing, both compressed domain processing and Rivl, is available online The common theme of all these efforts is to provide tools to make video usable in our research environment A talk that reviews this research is also available online Teaching At Cornell

systems become widespread in mission-critical applications My research has focused on the development of these techniques I have been heavily involved in applying assertional reasoning to the design of concurrent, distributed, fault-tolerant, and real-time programs I am completing a textbook on this subject Along with David Gries, I continue investigations concerning our first-order equational logic E This past year, we streamlined the inference rules and evaluated a number of techniques for handling undefined terms and partial functions Thomas Bressoud and I completed building and analyzing our hypervisor-based implementation of replication management for HP's PA-RISC architecture Our protocols ensure that the sequence of instructions executed by two virtual machines running on different physical processors are identical The protocols also coordinate I/O issued by these virtual machines Use of a hypervisor to implement replica coordination is attractive - at least, in theory When replica coordination is implemented in a hypervisor, it instantly becomes available to all hardware realizations of the given instruction-set architecture, including realizations that did not exist when the hypervisor was written Second, when replica coordination is implemented in a hypervisor, a single implementation suffices for every operating system that executes on that instruction-set architecture Finally, by implementing replica coordination in a hypervisor, the applications programmer is freed from this task Jointly with Dag Johansen (University of Troms&oslash;, Norway) and Robbert van Renesse, I started the TACOMA project (Troms&oslash; And COrnell Moving Agents) to investigate support and use of mobile processes in building mission-critical applications By structuring a system in terms of agents, applications can be constructed in which communication-network bandwidth is conserved Data may be accessed only by an agent executing at the same site as the data resides An agent typically will filter or otherwise reduce the data it reads, carrying with it only the relevant information as it roams the network Two TACOMA prototypes have been completed, and we are implementing a third system based on our experiences Finally, I developed with Scott Stoller a new algorithm for detecting whether a particular computation of an asynchronous distributed system could have passed through a global state satisfying some given state predicate The new algorithm allows more efficient detection than is possible with previous algorithms University Activities

SELECTED PUBLICATIONS NLP and ML Links My entry in the department annual report Amalgams softball stats Finger Lakes Tandem Tour with the Westys, 1995 Research Interests Although my research spans a number of subfields within artificial intelligence, including machine learning, case-based reasoning, and cognitive modeling, the focus of my research is in the area of natural language understanding (NLP/NLU) The NLP group at Cornell is primarily interested in investigating the use of machine learning techniques as tools for guiding natural language system development and for exploring the mechanisms that underly language acquisition Our work focuses on two related areas: (1) the design of user-trained systems that can efficiently and reliably extract the important information from a document, and (2) the machine learning of natural language Information Extraction As part of Cornell's CSTR project, we are using information extraction techniques to support content-based browsing of technical texts The Kenmore Project The focus of the Kenmore project is on developing techniques to automate the knowledge acquisition tasks that comprise the building of any NLP system Very generally, Kenmore acquires linguistic knowledge using a combination of symbolic machine learning techniques and robust sentence analysis It has been used with corpora from two real-world domains to perform part-of-speech tagging, semantic feature tagging, and concept activation and to find the antecedents of relative pronouns In current work, we are extending Kenmore to handle larger text corpora and additional disambiguation tasks In all of our work, we evaluate the language learning components in the context of the larger NLP application in which it is embedded The goal of the project is to determine the conditions under which machine learning techniques can be expected to offer a cost-effective approach to knowledge acquisition for NLP systems Teaching CS674 Natural

166	 Kenneth P Birman Kenneth P Birman Professor PhD Univ of California, Berkeley, 1981 My research is concerned with fault-tolerant distributed computing and operating systems My focus is on using a distributed programming model based upon virtual synchronous process groups to solve such problems as managing replicated data, coordinating actions in a distributed setting, and performing dynamic reconfiguration This is done in a way that provides fault-tolerance, although it is limited to certain classes of reasonably benign failures My effort has a theoretical and a practical side The practical work started in 1985, when we developed a computing system called the Isis Toolkit Isis, with software tools to support virtual synchrony and fault-tolerance, became widely popular We are now developing a new system, Horus, which is intended to be more flexible than Isis and which addresses issues such as real-time communication and security The most important feature of Horus is its extensive use of layering, which permits it to be reconfigured for special purposes The basic idea is that Horus users should pay only for features that they actually use but should have available a very broad collection of options Horus also seeks leverage from the emergence of ATM network technology and from communication techniques such as Active Messages, which originated in work on parallel supercomputers Horus embodies an advanced security technology, developed by graduate students Mike Reiter and David Cooper, which is unusual in combining security, privacy, and high availability in a single package On the more fundamental side of the effort, the Horus group is looking at techniques for specifying and proving properties of process-group structured systems We are using the ML language to develop executable �reference implementations�� of the major Horus layers, with the goal of using Constable�s Nuprl system to prove that the latter correctly implements the former We are also studying extensions of the virtual synchrony model, notably in work by Roy Friedman on adding real-time guarantees to Horus and in work by Mark Hayden on support for probabilistic broadcast primitives and programming tools Horus is very much a collaboration The architecture and development side of the effort is headed by Dr Robbert van Renesse, Werner Vogels and Roy Friedman Six graduate students are working on aspects of the system, including the development of object-oriented programming tools for multimedia communication applications, security and privacy, high-speed protocols that exploit ATM, and other problems We are also collaborating within the department, notably with Thorsten von Eicken and Brian Smith University Activities Chair, Engineering Policy Committee Acting Head, Computer Science Department Master of Engineering Program Member, Computer Science Department Faculty Recruiting Committee Member, Cornell Academic Leadership Committee Professional Activities Editor in Chief, ACM Transactions on Computing Systems Chief Scientist, Isis Distributed Systems, Inc Member: ISAT study group on Robustness of Critical Elements of the National Information Infrastructure Publications The process group approach to reliable distributed computing Communications of the ACM 36, 12 (December 1993), 37-53 Integrating runtime consistency models for distributed computing Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing 23, (Nov 1994), 158-176 Reliable distributed computing using the Isis toolkit (eds K P Birman and R van Renesse) IEEE Computer Society Press (1994), Los Alamitos, California Reliability through consistency IEEE Software 12, 3 (May 1995), 29-41 (with B Glade) Distributed Software Horus system Return to: 1994-1995 Annual Report Home Page Departmental Home Page If you have questions or comments please contact: www@cs cornell edu Last modified: 24 November 1995 by Denise Moore (denise@cs cornell edu) 	1

the standard message passing in order to reduce communication overheads and to offer a good building block for higher layers of software The first part of this paper describes an implementation of Active Messages (SP AM) which is layered directly on top of the SP's network adapter (TB2) With comparable bandwidth, SP AM's low overhead yields a round-trip latency that is 40% lower than IBM MPL's The second part of the paper demonstrates the power of AM as a communication substrate by layering Split-C as well as MPI over it Split-C benchmarks are used to compare the SP to other MPPs and show that low message overhead and high throughput compensate for SP's high network latency The MPI implementation is based on the freely available MPICH version and achieves performance equivalent to IBM's MPI-F on the NAS benchmarks Design and Performance of Active Messages on the SP-2 Chi-Chao Chang, Grzegorz Czajkowski, and Thorsten von Eicken, Cornell CS Technical Report 96-1572, February 1996 Abstract: This technical report describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of Active Messages on the IBM SP-2 The implementation benchmarked here uses the standard TB2 network adapter firmware but does not use any IBM software on the Power2 processor We assume familiarity with the concepts underlying Active Messages The main performance characteristics are a one-word message round-trip time of 51 0 us and an asymptotic network bandwidth of 34 3 MB/s After presenting selected implementation details, the paper focuses on detailed performance analysis, including a comparison with IBM's Message Passing Layer (MPL) and Split-C benchmarks Generic Active Message Specification, Version 1 1 The Generic Active Message Specification, Version 1 1 defines an Active Messages interface which is portable across a variety of parallel machines Implementations are available for the U-Net ATM cluster , the Meiko CS-2 , the HPAM FDDI ring , the Paragon , and the SP-2 Low-Latency Communication over ATM Networks using Active Messages Thorsten von Eicken, Veena Avula, Anyndia Basu, Vineet Buch, Presented at Hot Interconnects II , Aug 1994, Palo Alto, CA An abridged version of this paper appears in IEEE Micro Magazine, Feb 1995 Slides from Hot Interconnect talk Abstract: Recent developments in communication architectures for parallel machines have made significant progress and reduced the communication overheads and latencies by over an order of magnitude as compared to earlier proposals This paper examines whether these techniques can carry over to clusters of workstations connected by an ATM network even though clusters use standard operating system software, are equipped with network interfaces optimized for stream communication, do not allow direct protected user-level access to the network, and use networks without reliable transmission or flow control In a first part, this paper describes the differences in communication characteristics between clusters of workstations built from standard hardware and software components and state-of-the-art multiprocessors The lack of flow control and of operating system coordination affects the communication layer design significantly and requires larger buffers at each end than on multiprocessors A second part evaluates a prototype implementation of the low-latency Active Messages communication model on a Sun workstation cluster interconnected by an ATM network Measurements show application-to-application latencies of about 20 microseconds for small messages which is roughly comparable to the Active Messages implementation on the Thinking Machines CM-5 multiprocessor Active Messages: a Mechanism for Integrated Communication and Computation von Eicken, T , D E Culler, S C Goldstein, and K E Schauser, Proceedings of the 19th Int'l Symp on Computer Architecture , May 1992, Gold Coast, Australia Abstract The design challenge for large-scale multiprocessors is (1) to minimize communication overhead, (2) allow communication to overlap computation, and (3) coordinate the two without sacrificing processor cost/performance We show that existing message passing multiprocessors have unnecessarily high communication costs Research prototypes of message driven machines demonstrate low communication overhead, but poor processor cost/performance We introduce a simple communication mechanism, Active Messages , show that it is intrinsic to both architectures, allows cost effective use of the hardware, and offers tremendous flexibility Implementations on nCUBE/2 And CM-5 are described and evaluated using a split-phase shared-memory extension to C, Split-C We further show that active messages are sufficient to implement the dynamically scheduled languages for which message driven machines were designed With this mechanism, latency tolerance becomes a programming/compiling concern Hardware support for active messages is desirable and we outline a range of enhancements to mainstream processors Active Messages: an Efficient Communication Architecture for Multiprocessors von Eicken, T , Ph D Thesis, November 1993, University of

Document Contents: Project Objectives Current Status Motivating Example SEQ Data Model Sequin Query Language Optimization Techniques SEQ System Development Publications Related Work Contact Information Project Objectives A number of important database applications require the processing of large amounts of ordered sequence data The domains of these applications include financial management, historical analysis, economic and social sciences, metereology, medical sciences and biological sciences Existing relational databases are inadequate in this regard; data collections are treated as sets, not sequences Consequently, expressing sequence queries is tedious, and evaluating them is inefficient Databases should model the data using the abstraction of sequences , allow data sequences to be queried in a declarative manner , utilizing the ordered semantics take advantage of the unique opportunities available for query optimization and evaluation integrate sequence data with relational data, so that users can store and query a combination of relation and sequences These requirements serve as the goals of the SEQ project Various kinds of sequences need to be supported, temporal sequences being the most important kind Queries should be expressible using notions like "next" and "previous" which are natural when considering sequences These queries should be optimized so that they can be evaluated efficiently These issues need to be studied in theory, and then a database system needs to be built that demonstrates the feasibility of the theoretical ideas Project Status The current status of the project is: We have defined the SEQ data model that can support most important kinds of sequence data We have also defined algebraic query operators that can be composed to form sequence queries (analogous to the composition of relational algebra operators to form relation queries) We have described how sequence queries can be efficiently processed, and have identified various optimization techniques We use a sequence query language Sequin that can declaratively express queries over sequences A Sequin query can include embedded expressions in a relational query language like SQL, or vice-versa We are building a disk-based database system to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposals The system implements the SEQ model using a nested complex object architecture It is built over the SHORE storage manager and can process several megabytes of data Relations and sequences are supported in an integrated and extensible manner Motivating Example of a Sequence Query A weather monitoring system records information about various meteorological phenomena There is a sequentiality in the occurrence of these phenomena; the various meteorological events are sequenced by the time at which they are recorded A scientist asks the query: "For which volcano eruptions did the most recent earthquake have a strength greater than 7 0 on the Richter scale " If this query is to be expressed in a relational query language like SQL, complex features like groupby clauses, correlated subqueries and aggregate functions are required Further, a conventional relational query optimizer would not find an efficient query execution plan, even given the knowledge that the Earthquakes and Volcano relations are sorted by time However a very efficient plan exists, if one models the data as sequences ordered by time The two sequences can be scanned in lock step (similar to a sort merge join) The most recent earthquake record scanned can be stored in a temporary buffer Whenever a volcano record is processed, the value of the most recent earthquake record stored in the buffer is checked to see if its strength was greater than 7 0, possibly generating an answer This query can therefore be processed with a single scan of the two sequences, and using very little memory The key to such optimization is the sequentiality of the data and the query Data Model The details of the SEQ data model are described in a published paper (click here for postscript version) Here we present the gist of it The basic model of a sequence is a set of records mapped to an ordered domain of ``positions'' This many-to-many relationship between records and positions can be viewed in two dual but distinct ways: as a set of records mapped to each position, or as a set of positions mapped to each record These two views are called ``Positional'' and ``Record-Oriented'' respectively, and each gives rise to a set of query operators based on that view Queries on sequences could require operators of either or both flavors The Record-Oriented operators are similar to relational operators and include various kinds of joins (overlap, containment, etc) and aggregates Such operators have been extensively explored by researchers in the temporal database community The Positional operators include Next, Previous, Offset, Moving Aggregates, etc Further operators allow ``zooming'' operations on sequences by means of collapsing and expanding the ordering domains associated with the sequence For instance, a daily sequence could be ``zoomed out'' (i e collapsed) to a weekly sequence, or ``zoomed in'' (i e expanded) to an hourly sequence The last part of the model deals with operations on groups (i e sets) of sequences The advantage is that this makes it easy to model queries involving sequence collections (which is the case in many real-world situations) All the sequence operators are extended to work with groups of similar sequences, instead of with single sequences This extension of the SEQ model indicates that a practical implementation of SEQ would probably involve a nested complex object system Sequin Query Language We have devised a query language called Sequin using which declarative sequence queries can be specified The language is similar in flavor to SQL, except that the inputs to queries as well as the results of queries are sequences Click here for a description of the Sequin language with examples Optimization Techniques We have proposed new optimization techniques for sequence queries involving Positional operators There are existing techniques that have been proposed for queries with Record-Oriented operators Our optimizations use query transformations, meta--data, and caching of intermediate results to efficiently evaluate a query An optimal query evaluation plan can be generated using an algorithm that relies on cost estimates One of the important observations is that accessing sequence data in a single stream is probably very efficient, and evaluation strategies should take this into account The details of the optimization techniques are described in a published paper (click here for postscript version) System Development The SEQ database system has a client-server architecture, supporting multiple clients via a multi-threaded server The server is built on top of the SHORE storage manager Both Sequin and a subset of SQL are supported as query languages which can be embedded inside each other The data model is a nested complex object model that allows arbitrary levels of nesting of relations inside sequences and vice versa The system is also extensible, providing support for new data types, new ordering domains, user-defined functions, new storage

A number of &quot;advanced fundamental&quot; DBMS concepts will be covered Although this is not intended to be an introductory course, it is a new course and there may be students in the class with different backgrounds Consequently, the discussion of various topics will begin with a quick review of basic material taught in CS 432 Click here for a tentative list of topics to be covered In terms of workload, here's what the course involves: There will be a midterm and a final examination These will test a breadth of basic concepts Each student will have to do a survey paper on a specific advanced topic Here is a list of possible topics The purpose of this is to be aware that what is being taught in the course is only a fraction of what is out there This paper will be due three weeks after the midterm, and should be complete with references It will require reading papers from journals and conference proceedings in the engineering library I will suggest initial references, and you will have to pursue additional references from there Click here for information on reference material in the library A development project involving C++ programming Look here for more information There will be no written homework assignments Students take turns writing lecture notes Depending on enrollment, this means each person will have to take notes once or twice in the semester Hopefully, this additional work will turn out to be useful around exam time Here are the details (in ps) Development Project The term project is an important part of the course, and will involve a significant amount of C++ programming You can choose whether you wish to work alone or in teams of two However, the two-person projects will involve proportionally more work The goal of the project is two-fold: (a) to get hands-on experience at building some specific DBMS component, (b) to get comfortable working with a large pre-existing code-base, and modifying it in a modular manner The second goal is as important as the first one, because all database systems are huge software systems, and rarely do you have the luxury of starting from scratch This forces you to write modular code, and also to understand the interaction between the different system components when the inevitable bugs appear There are two research DBMS prototypes that will be used in the projects One is MINIBASE, which is software associated with the textbook It is a simple single-user database system that provides all the components from the SQL parser down to the disk manager This should hopefully be available, depending on our being able to compile and run it in our computing environment The important part of MINIBASE is the interface description of the various system components The actual code comes from class projects Consequently, projects using MINIBASE will involve writing a component (like the buffer manager), based on a specification of its C++ interface The other prototype is PREDATOR, which is a query processing engine that I have been developing for my research There are a number of possible projects (some of which could lead to research topics) that can be built on top of PREDATOR The focus here is on the high-end functionality like complex queries and new data types If you are not familiar with C++, I recommend a MINIBASE project because the amount of design needed is minimal If you think you are interested in database systems research, then you should do a PREDATOR project If you fall in neither category, then you should decide whether you want a project at the lower-level DBMS (storage, access, buffer) areas, or the higher-level (query processing, optimization) areas and choose between MINIBASE (lower-level) and PREDATOR (higher-level) There are also some general projects that involve neither system If you have your own idea on a suitable project, you should talk with me about it well in advance of the project proposal date Here is a tentative list of possible projects In all the projects, there will be certain steps that should be followed: As part of the project proposal, you should (discuss with me) and submit an ordered list of pieces of functionality that the project will produce There will be a mid-project review in which you meet with me to discuss the progress that you have made towards completing the project The code you write must follow the coding conventions of the particular system that you are working on A detailed coding conventions document will be provided and should be followed closely This is something that I will be very picky on, and that will contribute to the grade you get on the project Project submission should include a demo and a reasonable amount of test data Some useful references are: Home page for PREDATOR Home page for MINIBASE Course TextBook The primary text is a beta edition of a new book on database systems : &quot;Database Management Systems&quot;

Instructions for posters: you may pick-up a 3'x4' poster board from Cindy Williams in 4105b and you are limited to this one board! Please hold it horizontally so I can hang the boards in the corridor Instructions for poster session: you will have 10 minutes to present your poster, plus a few minutes for questions Try to give everyone a sense of the problem you attacked, the solutions you contemplated, and the results you've gotten (or what you've learned) Your presentations will be be judged by how well you get your message across Every member of the group should participate in the presentation (Non-native speaker difficulties will be taken into consideration ) Instructions for final web report: your final report should be on /vol/www/Info/Courses/Current/CS516 by monday May 5th at noon (absolutely ALL pages MUST be in a subdirectory of the above) It will be the most important contribution of your project as well as the longest-lasting! Your web pages will remain on our server for years to come and many people will find them via the search engines! The final report should start with the usual introduction to the problem you are trying to solve, followed by a thorough discussion of the trade-offs This is the most important part: you need to explain why you chose the solution you did, what other options you considered, and why you rejected them Your project will be judged by us (and future web readers) by how well you convice us that you arrived at the best solution Showcase your work using ample experimental data with good explanations on what exactly you measured!

99	 About Jim Davis at the Design Research Institute Jim Davis Xerox Corporation PhD, MIT Media Lab 1989 davis@dri cornell edu My goal in general is to build software systems that improve communication among people I believe that communication mediums of the future will have an increasing understanding of the structure and content of the messages they transmit They will manipulate, reformat, and even generate that content I am interested in hypertext systems, network information access, and collaboration I work on the CSTR project , an ARPA sponsored effort to make computer science technical reports more easily accessible As part of that work, I designed a distributed technical report server which is now running at many universities I am interested in Corporate (or Group) Memory, meaning electronic systems for capturing and accessing the knowledge used and produced by (the workers of) an institution, in order to increase the quality of or reduce the time required to do future work Corporate memory includes not just the intellectual products of the institution (e g an engineer's designs, a lawyer's contracts, an author's screenplays) but also knowledge about the process that produced the product: knowledge of dead-ends explored, tools used, and justifications supporting the final decisions I have also begun a project (with Dan Huttenlocher) in developing corporate memory through shared annotation of structured documents This project investigates how people can share information by reading and writing annotations in electronic documents shared by the group An initial prototype implementation is being used by Cornell class CS212 Here, the shared documents are problem sets and course notes, and a nnotations might be requests for clarifications by students, technical questions, or corrections made by staff The question is whether this will be a useful means for students to obtain answers, whether students will find each other's questions a useful source for learning, whether students will often be able to answer each other's questions (correctly), and whether the course staff will find this a useful means for feedback in improving the course So far, the evidence is that they do I'm also interested in natural language generation and the design of computational proxies ("agents") which can safely and reliably carry out remote computations on foreign machines without risk to either you or the owner of the remote machine See also Papers Online copies of some of my publicatiions Web resource for the DRI A list of Web resources that seem especially useful for the DRI my web resources Resources I've collected that seem useful (or fun) to me professional history This is a narrative, not a resume Contact improvisation Is it a sport or an art Resume No, I'm not in the job market But thanks for asking I like it just fine at Xerox 	4

9	 Richard Zippel Richard Zippel Senior Research Associate rz@cs cornell edu Ph D MIT, 1979 My research focuses on using symbolic mathematics and modern software techniques to automate the generation of scientific software, currently focusing on computational fluid dynamics This work will allow a scientist to specify the differential equations to be studied, the mathematical techniques that will be used perform the numerical computations and the architecture of the machine on which the calculations will be done The toolkit then converts the differential equations, via the supplied methods, into specialized code for the architecture With colleagues in the department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, this toolkit has been used to generate the dynamical systems that arise in the study of the boundary layers in fluids A component of this toolkit is a computer algebra substrate called Weyl, that extends the data structures available in Common Lisp to include objects like polynomials, matrices, rational functions, rings, vector spaces, and ideals The introduction of these new objects into a programming language provides a number of new challenges to the language's type system and provides new opportunities for deductive reasoning, which we are pursuing Professional Activities Editorial Board: Journal of Symbolic Computation; ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software Program Committee: Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming Workshop '94 Referee/Reviewer: AOR; NSF; Journal of Algebraic Algorithms and Error Correcting Codes ; International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation Lectures Algebraic Function Decomposition American Mathematical Society Regional Meeting, Syracuse, New York, September 12, 1993 (with Dexter Kozen and Susan Landau - Dexter Kozen presenter) __ American Mathematical Society Regional Meeting, Syracuse, New York, May 6, 1994 (Susan Landau presenter) Effective Algorithms for Polynomial Irreducibility Testing American Mathematical Society Regional Meeting, Syracuse, New York, September 12, 1993 Vista: A MicroStorage Architecture International Workshop on Object Oriented Operating Systems, Durham, North Carolina, December 10, 1993 (joint with Dawson Dean - Dawson Dean presenter) __ IBM Scientific Center, Haifa, Israel, January 6, 1994 __ Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion, Haifa, Israel, January 9, 1994 Synthesizing Scientific Programs using SPL/Weyl Department of Computer Science, Weizmann Institute, Rehovot, Israel, December 28, 1993 __ Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion, Haifa, Israel, January 3, 1994 __ Department of Computer Science, SUNY, Albany, New York, April 20, 1994 A New Modular Interpolation Algorithm for Factoring Multivariate Polynomials Algebra and Number Theory Symposium, Ithaca, New York, May 7, 1994 (joint with Ronitt Rubinfeld - Ronitt Rubinfeld presenter) Publications Effective Polynomial Computation Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston Massachusetts (June 1993), 368 pages Vista: A Microstorage Architecture That Implements File Systems and Object Databases Proceedings of the International Workshop on Object Oriented Databases (December 1993), 194-198 (with Dawson Dean) Return to: List of Researchers 1993-1994 Annual Report Home Page Departmental Home Page If you have questions or comments please contact: www@cs cornell edu Last modified: 9 November 1994 by Denise Moore (denise@cs cornell edu) 	4
